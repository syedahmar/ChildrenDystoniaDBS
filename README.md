# ChildrenDystoniaDBS
This repository contains the MATLAB code associated with our publication analysing paediatric DBS outcomes for children with Dystonia. 

Citation information will be added once the paper is accepted for publication.

To run the analysis, type Analysis_A in the command line. 
Please note that the data used is dummy data and therefore the results generated will not match those found in the publication. We still hope that this code will be useful to better understand our methodology. The actual data can be requested from us, which can be shared after De-identified data will be made available to interested researchers upon scientific protocol evaluation committee approval and subject to study governance structure and patient consent form, following a time restriction.
